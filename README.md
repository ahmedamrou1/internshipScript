Quick side project to set up a notification system every time a new internship is added to https://github.com/Ouckah/Summer2025-Internships. Connects to SMTP server, scrapes HTML tag data from the ReadMe file in the repo using BeautifulSoup4, and notifies every time a new company is added to the list. This was fun!
